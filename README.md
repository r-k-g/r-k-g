## Hello!
Thanks for stopping by. I'm a software engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

## Other projects
These projects are hosted on Bitbucket, I may get around to moving them here someday.

### Minesweeper
- A minesweeper clone I made with pyFLTK. I was originally trying to replicate Windows XP but I wasn’t able to get my hands on anything running it, so I settled for windows 95 behavior and Windows XP-like sprites
 
### Space invaders <img align="right" width="197" height="153" src="https://gaertner.ca/rowan/spaceinvaders/assets/images/menu_screen.PNG">
  -  A space invaders-style game I made to learn pygame. I remarkably spent much more time on the menu screen than anything else.

### Vigenère cipher GUI
 -  A project I undertook to learn Tkinter, one of my first attempts at GUI programming. The part that does the encryption/decryption and key-guessing was part of an earlier project.

### MP3 player <img align="right" width="225" height="167" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-k-g/r-k-g/master/mp3player.png">
  -  pyFLTK GUI to organize songs into playlists and play them with VLC media player

## Hello!
Thanks for stopping by.

#### Here's what I'm working on right now:
  - Learning new languages

## Other projects

These projects aren't on github.  

### Minesweeper
- a minesweeper clone I made with pyFLTK. I was originally trying to replicate Windows XP but I wasn’t able to get my hands on anything running it, so I settled for windows 95 behavior and Windows XP-like sprites
 
### Space invaders <img align="right" width="197" height="153" src="https://gaertner.ca/rowan/spaceinvaders/assets/images/menu_screen.PNG">
  -  a space invaders-style game I made to learn pygame. The code now terrifies me, but I put some stuff into a [joke website about it](https://gaertner.ca/rowan/spaceinvaders/)


### Vigenère cipher GUI
 -  A project I undertook to learn Tkinter, also one of my first forays into GUI programming. The part that does the encryption/decryption and key-guessing was part of an earlier project.

### MP3 player <img align="right" width="225" height="167" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-k-g/r-k-g/master/mp3player.png">
  -  pyFLTK GUI to organize songs into playlists and play them with VLC media player
